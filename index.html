     <h1>Rick Lin</h1>
    <p id="aboutme">I'm a Certified Electrical Engineering Technologist with a strong focus on building electrical system
    design. Over the years, I’ve worked across a wide variety types of projects—contributing to
    safe, efficient, and code-compliant electrical systems. Whether it's power distribution, 
    lighting, fire alarm, or infrastructure support, I approach every project with attention to 
    detail and a commitment to collaboration.
    Beyond design, I’m deeply involved in construction administration and BIM/Revit model
    optimization, helping ensure ideas on paper become reliable, buildable systems on-site. My
    goal is to deliver technically sound, coordinated designs that serve both the client’s goals
    and the realities of construction. I work well independently or as part of a multidisciplinary
    team, and I’m always seeking to simplify complexity through thoughtful planning and streamlined documentation.</p>

    <div class="accordion-content">
     <p>Thoughtful lighting design is critical to both form and function. I develop tailored lighting systems that enhance
        occupant experience, meet energy efficiency goals, and comply with regional codes and standards. My expertise includes
        photometric analysis, fixture specification, and the integration of lighting control systems—whether simple occupancy
        sensing or complex networked DALI/0-10V controls for modern smart buildings.</p>

    <div class="accordion-content">
     <p>Protecting lives and property is at the core of every fire alarm system I design. My approach includes strategic device
        layout and adherence to local building and fire codes (e.g., NFPA 72, ULC-S524). Whether working on new construction
        or retrofit projects, I ensure systems are well-integrated with other building services, easy to maintain, and
        inspection-ready.</p>

    <div class="accordion-content">
     <p>While I don’t design low voltage systems themselves, I provide the essential power and pathway infrastructure they depend
        on. From structured cabling raceways to telecom room power provisions, my designs enable smooth deployment of AV, security,
        data, and communications systems. I coordinate closely with IT and specialty vendors to ensure compatibility and
        future expandability.</p>

     <p>A great design only succeeds when it’s built as intended. I actively support projects through the construction phase—reviewing
        shop drawings, answering RFIs, and performing field reviews to ensure electrical installations align with design documents.
        My goal is to be a responsive and solutions-oriented partner throughout construction, helping resolve issues quickly and clearly.</p>

     <p>I use BIM not just as a modeling tool, but as a platform for coordination and efficiency. With a strong foundation in Revit,
        I build clean, lightweight, and highly-coordinated electrical models that support clash detection, quantity takeoffs, and
        clear documentation. I also develop and implement workflows that streamline model maintenance and ensure consistency across
        large, multi-phase projects.</p>
